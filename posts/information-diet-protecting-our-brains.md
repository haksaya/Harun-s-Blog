In today's world, accessing information has never been easier, but it's equally dangerous. Yuval Noah Harari emphasizes the importance of properly nourishing our brains through the information diet approach. So, what does this mean and how can it be applied in our daily lives?

First, we must realize this: I don't need to know what my elementary school friend had for dinner. Social media is drowning us in unnecessary details. Once upon a time, receiving news and gaining knowledge was meaningful; now, news culture has almost disappeared. Every small detail presented to us is served as a "piece of news," slowly rotting our brains.

Short videos not only create rapid emotional transitions but also hijack our brains as part of the attention economy. These contents, designed to capture our attention every second and direct us to click and watch, weaken our ability for long-term thinking and deep learning. We used to learn by digesting information; now it passes by in seconds and our minds are constantly stimulated.

A future trend is emerging: not being on social media is becoming cool and an accepted stance. As Harari says, the information diet is not just about what you consume, but also about what you don't consume. Protecting our brains from unnecessary stimuli has become a sign of strength in the modern world.

Finally, the most critical step: becoming a conscious information consumer. Choosing our sources correctly, not falling for manipulation, and not letting our minds rot is now a necessity. Every click, every like, every view sends a message to our brain; we must now pay attention to what we're receiving.

Remember: The information you give your brain determines your future. Choose your diet, don't allow mental decay and the fragmentation of your attention!
