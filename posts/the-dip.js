Every new project (or career, or relationship) starts out exciting and fun. Then it gets harder and less fun, until it hits a low point—really hard, and not much fun at all.

And then you find yourself wondering if it’s worth it.

That's the Dip.

The people who make it through the Dip are the ones who become the best in the world. The people who quit in the Dip are the ones who waste their time and energy.`;
