# The Limits of Artificial Intelligence

We are living through interesting times.

The wave of digitalization that accelerated with the pandemic completely disrupted the balance of supply and demand. Software developers suddenly became as rare and valuable as precious fabric.  Many of my colleagues in academia were planning to resign and move into the private sector—quite a few of them actually did. At the time, this decision seemed perfectly rational.

Last week, during a conversation with one of those friends, I learned that he has been unemployed for nearly a year and still hasn't been able to find a new position. 

This dramatic shift happened in just three short years. In a sector that transforms this rapidly, survival is no longer just a matter of technical skills; it has become a strategy—and even an art—in itself.

Reflecting on this picture led me to a clear conclusion: for the next 5–10 years, the right approach is not to focus on what artificial intelligence can do, but on what it cannot do. 

Don't misunderstand me—I'm not saying "go become a farmer" or "learn carpentry." Every profession, every area of expertise, contains layers that AI cannot easily take over. What matters is recognizing those layers within your own work.

Artificial intelligence calculates, produces, accelerates, and optimizes.

But it still has serious limitations when it comes to deeply understanding context, accepting and living with uncertainty, taking ethical responsibility, developing original intuition, and carrying decisions that require genuine human contact. That's why the real issue is not changing professions, but amplifying the human value embedded within your profession.

No matter what you do, there are areas that artificial intelligence has not yet touched—and will not easily touch. Find those areas, nurture them, and invest in them.  In the future, those who make a difference will not be the ones who use AI the best, but those who consciously build the abilities that AI cannot replace.
