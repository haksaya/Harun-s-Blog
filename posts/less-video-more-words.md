The age we live in is built on watching and listening. The moment our fingers touch the screen, images start to flow, voices begin to speak, and algorithms decide what—and how much—we consume. Reading, on the other hand, is steadily pushed into the background; it has become an act that demands patience, that requires us to pause.

Especially short videos… A few seconds of pleasure, content consumed at high speed, an endlessly refreshing stream. As our minds adapt to this rhythm, our attention span narrows. Following a long text becomes difficult; thinking starts to feel exhausting. Speed replaces meaning, reaction replaces depth.

Words, however, do not rush. Reading teaches us to slow down. It allows us to think within a sentence, to get lost in a paragraph. Words do more than inform us; they slow us, deepen us, transform us.

Perhaps the issue is not technology, but choice.

Less video, more words…

Because some ideas are not meant to be watched; they are meant to be read, reflected upon, and allowed to grow within us.
