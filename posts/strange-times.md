Being intelligent once opened doors; today, those doors are opened by follower counts. What you know matters less than how many people are watching you. Knowledge gives way to visibility; depth is replaced by fast-consumed opinions.
While artificial intelligence quietly gnaws at white-collar work, academia is left gasping in citation metrics. Expertise, once the product of years of effort, is now treated as “too much detail.” In the age of speed, thinking is seen as slowness, doubt as indecision, and depth as a luxury.
This transformation affects not only people, but also the systems that produce knowledge. Constant demands for speed and efficiency reward quantity over quality. More content, less judgment; more repetition, less originality. In such an environment, error is no longer an exception—it becomes the system’s natural output.
The irony is this: even language models, as they increasingly feed on their own generated texts, begin to dilute knowledge and amplify mistakes. We are constructing a reality made of copies of copies—shiny, yet hollow. Being smart is no longer enough; sometimes, it even becomes a burden. Meaning dissolves into noise, and numbers step ahead of thought.
Strange times…
