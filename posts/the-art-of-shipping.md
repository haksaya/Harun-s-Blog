Perfect is the enemy of done.

We've all heard it. But how many of us actually live it?

You're working on something. A project, a blog post, a product. It's 90% complete. Maybe 95%. But you keep tweaking. One more feature. One more revision. One more day.

The lizard brain whispers: "Not yet. It's not ready."

Here's the thing: It will never be ready. Not really.

## Ship It

Shipping is a practice. The more you ship, the better you get at it. Not at building perfect things, but at building things that matter.

Seth Godin ships a blog post every single day. Not all of them are masterpieces. But they're all shipped. And over time, that practice compounds.

**The world doesn't need more perfect things gathering dust.** It needs your work, messy and incomplete as it might be, out in the world making a difference.

So what are you waiting for?

Ship it. Today. Then start on the next one.
