Yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some other, less effective task in order to make the original task possible.

It goes like this: "I want to wax the car today."

"Oops, the hose is broken. I'll go buy a new one at Home Depot."

"But the car won't start. I need a new battery."

"The battery shop is next to the barber."

"I'll get a haircut while I'm there."

And so, hours later, you are getting a haircut instead of waxing the car.

Don't shave the yak. Do the work.`;
