    content: `These days, everyone working in jobs outside of manual crafts requiring handiwork is experiencing similar fears.

Will artificial intelligence take my job away?

Actually, this situation is not new. In the 60s, when electronic calculators were invented and reduced to desk size, calculation specialists and educational institutions that trained calculation specialists experienced similar fears. In the 80s, when ATMs started being used in Turkey, bankers worried that they would become unemployed. At the point we've reached, everyone who could adapt to technology and learn quickly continued to do their work and earn their living. I think the key words are being flexible and being able to learn quickly. Those who could do this continued to practice their transforming professions. Those who couldn't were eliminated. Artificial intelligence will eliminate some "bullshit jobs," in David Graeber's phrase. And it should.

In the work we do and the real-life problems we solve, we don't just use our intelligence. Along with intelligence, we also use our intuition, consciousness, and emotions. Humanity has succeeded in mathematically modeling intelligence at the point we've reached and has been able to transfer it to machines. However, we don't yet have an approach to model our consciousness, intuition, and emotions. Perhaps we never will. That's why humans will continue to remain unique.

One of the areas where generative artificial intelligence is perhaps best at is writing code. Despite this, artificial intelligence won't take away my job as a software developer. Because to do my job as a software developer, I need not only my intelligence but also my consciousness and intuition. This being the case, artificial intelligence can be a powerful tool, a lever, that I use to do the tasks I consider drudgery and to automate them.`
